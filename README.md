# Welcome

Hi there! I'm Kia! I enjoy learning and making as many interesting programs that I can find. From way to large robots to Nintendo 3DS apps I like poking around in it.

## More About Me <a name="moreaboutme"></a>
As I said, my name is Kia, but my username here is pknocder. Fun fact! My username came from my steam account's randomly generated username as "pkngamer," and I have molded that username to lots of things (pkner being the un-specialized one).

## Contributions <a name="contributions"></a>
I currently work with the Perkins Pirates Robotics team. We go to First Robotics Competitions (FRC) under the ID number 7165. I help by programming the robot and trying to make a breadcrum path for any future programmers!

## Languages <a name="languages"></a>
I know a variety of programming languages, and don't plan on stopping on learning more! Also, I am including scripting and web languages since I do still use them, and are scattered around my code files!

### Known Languages <a name="knownlanguages"></a>
- Python
- Java
- C++
- A bit of Rust
- The usual "not actually programming languages" of HTML/CSS/JS
- Swift (spesifically Apple's Swift UI package)
- Metal
- GLSL

### Languages On My Radar <a name="radarlanguages"></a>
- Rust
- Go
- C
- ASM 

## Projects <a name="projects"></a>
I always have some sort of project going on, and a code file full of possible other items to work on that I have looked at in the past.
<br>
My current project(s) are:
- <a href="https://pkncoder.github.io">Kia's Cottage</a> (never ending)
- Our new robot for the Perkins Pirates Robotics Team
- App for teaching how games make fancy scenes through materials from brick to glass ball
- 3DS app programming

## Kia's Cottage <a name="kiascottage"></a>
I like to outline this project of mine, since it is fairly important to me.

Kia's Cottage is my website that holds many things, all using Static JavaScript, hosted off of Github Pages (because I am cheap). Link: <a href="https://pkncoder.github.io">https://pkncoder.github.io</a>

This website is a personal project about learning everything to do with making a website. I have looked into React, jQuery, Python Flask, and just pure JavaScript, HTML 5, and CSS.

I am always working on it, and update it occasionally. Usually in a big phase when there isn't anything else to be worked on.
