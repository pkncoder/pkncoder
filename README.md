- 👋 Hello, my name is pkncoder, I go by they/them, and I am (primarily) a Python developer.
- 👀 I am currently interested in Speedcubing, Astrophysics, and coding. All progressing in each!
- 🌱 I am currently learning HTML, CSS, and possibly Javascript for proceeding on my own website! I am also trying to progress in Python, thankfully I have a couple of good sources!
- 💞️ I am not looking to collaborate on anything at the moment, just trying to progress in many things!
- 📫 How to reach me? alex.h.preston@gmail.com is my email!
- 📖 I am trying to figure out what class of programming I like most, and these repositories are mostly for increasing skill.
(although some I actually use)
