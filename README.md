# About Me

Hello, I am pkncoder! I am a solo 'developer' that is trying to learn as much as I can. I strive to make professional, efficient, and readable code so I can live up to my father.

## More About Me
As I said, my username is pkncoder, however my name is Kia. I use (she/her) pronouns. And currently attend Perkins High School.

## Contributions
I currently only contribute to the Perkins Pirates FRC Robotics (7165) team as a programmer for our robot. I would like to use programming more in my community.

## Languages
I know a variety of programming languages, and don't plan on stopping on learning more! Also, I am including scripting and web languages since I do still use them, and are scattered around my code files!

### Known Languages
- Python
- Java
- JavaScript
- HTML 5
- CSS
- Bash
- C++ (still learning)

### Languages On My Radar
- Rust
- Go
- C
- ASM 

## Projects
I always have some sort of project going on, and a code file full of possible other items to work on that I have looked at in the past.
<br>
My current project(s) are:
- <a href="https://pkncoder.github.io">Kia's Cottage</a> (never ending)
- DnD Monster Fight / DnD Encounter Simulation

## Kia's Cottage
I like to outline this project of mine, since it is fairly important to me.

Kia's Cottage is my website that holds many things, all using Static JavaScript, hosted off of Github Pages (because I am cheap). Link: <a href="https://pkncoder.github.io">https://pkncoder.github.io</a>

This website is a personal project about learning everything to do with making a website. I have looked into React, jQuery, Python Flask, and just pure JavaScript, HTML 5, and CSS.

I am always working on it, and update it occasionally. Usually in a big phase when there isn't anything else to be worked on.
